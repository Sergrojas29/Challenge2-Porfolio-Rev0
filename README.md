# Challenge2-Porfolio-Rev0
Week 2 Challenge. Initial Portfolio.

## User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
    THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
    THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
    THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
    THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
    THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport


## Description 

Create an Initial Portfolio:
concept to create a titleblock as a base to create a profile:
Goal is to create most of the elements through html and CSS then later 
add addition elements and Interactivity using Java Script
